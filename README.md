# Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Data Science and Machine Learning** repository!

This repository is where I keep track of what Iâ€™m learning and building as I explore data science and machine learning. It includes my notes, practice work, and projects. My goal is to keep learning, apply what Iâ€™ve learned through real examples, and gradually build a solid understanding of the field.

Please feel free to explore and follow along!
