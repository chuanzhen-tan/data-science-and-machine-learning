# Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Data Science and Machine Learning** repository!

This space is dedicated to documenting my learning journey and hands-on projects as I explore the world of data. This repository will serve as a centralized hub for everything I practice and create along the way.The goal is to continuously learn, apply concepts through real-world examples, and build a strong foundation in data science and machine learning through consistent practice.

Feel free to explore and follow along!
